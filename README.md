# 2021ROS2Build
Code to cross-compile ROS2 Dashing from x86 Linux to arm-frc-linux-gnueabi compilier for FRC team use.
This process specifically targets the cross build of ROS 2 core and a few other dependencies for Dashing Diademata.
The build operates through docker and ends with a zipped archive that can be SCP transfered to the rio and "installed"
